# Budget Buddy

# Description
Expense tracking and budget setting app with user authentication. Allows users to log their expenses and income in order to analyze and use them to make better financial decisions. Also allows users to set a monthly budget and allocate amounts to different categories of expenses. Users can view the budgets side by side with their monthly expenses to critique their spending habits. 

# Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask, and SQLite with cs50's SQL library
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript

This is my first full-stack project as a beginner developer. After completing Harvard's CS50, I wanted to put together something by myself that uses the concepts and skills taught in cs50. This project will also be the final project for that course!

#Usage
Uses Flask as a web server. Clone git into your code editor. Run "export FLASK_APP = app.py". Run "flask run" to host the website on your device.
